2-D RPG

Top down, turnbased dungeon crawl game.
Navigate dangerous traps, fight powerfull
monsters, grow in skill and level. 

This game is loosly inspired on games such as:
 - Pokemon Mystery Dungeon
 - Dungeons of Dredmore
 - Fire Emblem francise
 - Legend of Zelda 


Players control an adventure through a series of 2d maps. 
The maps are tile based and movement takes place in turns.
The player can explore, attack monsters, interact with
items/ buttons in the map and (if they're not careful)
they can be killed and die. 

Currently, there is no play for a story. Instead we're 
focusing our efforts on building more mechanics/ 
practice more and more complicated programming challenges
than design challenges.
