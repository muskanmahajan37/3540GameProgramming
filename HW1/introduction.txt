I have a little over a year's worth of experience with Unity, and recently published a mobile game using the engine. 
I have no experience with Python, although I'm excited to learn.
I have limited experience with RPG Maker VX Ace (Ruby scripting along with drag and drop programming).
I have attended a few hack-a-thons/ game jams and have worked with small teams to develop virtual games before. 

From this course, I hope to get a solid foundation for using Unity. Currently I have just self taught the engine, so my understanding of the finer points, optimizations or other settings are lacking. I want to get exposure to other game engines also like Unreal, at least I would like to know where the starting point is so I can practice on my own. I'm also looking forward to building more pieces that I can showcase in a portfolio, both to apply for a game design position, but also as a general coding position. I want to grow my skills.

I'm also looking forward to getting to know others in the class and start networking with them. Learning about their personal projects, helping others to build/test and they would help me.
