Sorry for the late project turn in. I did email you on Friday, Feb 9th to confirm that I would be taking a late day.

The web build takes a while to compile. Git it a few minutes. Your browser may even prompt you to kill the page. I'm sorry that I couldn't optimize my algorithms any more.

Also, worth note, I'm still having tearing issues with the mesh. I believe the problem boils down to inaccuracies with the float data type and comparing x,y,z positions of Vector3s.
